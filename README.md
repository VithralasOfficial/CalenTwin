# CalenTwin

An event managing application built using Flutter & dart in an Android Studio Environment.

The application was built to integrate with a Spring server and an external database (In our project we used MongoDB).

The application holds many functions:
 1) SignUp and Login.
 2) Create an event.
 3) Delete an event.
 4) Add multiple events from a file.
 5) View each event.
 6) View upcoming events (range can be changed).

The code holds a Http_Caller.dart file in API package, this file contains the functions that connect the client with the spring server.

This project focused mainly on Android but can be used on IOS as well.
